As of my last update in January 2022, I don't have access to real-time information, including events that occurred after that time. Therefore, I can't provide specific details about the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2024. 

For the most accurate and up-to-date information about the IPL in 2024, I recommend checking reliable sports news websites, official IPL social media channels, or cricket governing bodies closer to the event date. They will provide the latest updates, schedules, team information, and match results for the IPL season.
